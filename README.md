# Robotics Course Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the Robotics Course. The projects focus on various robotics principles, control algorithms, and simulation techniques using tools like ROS (Robot Operating System) and sensor-based navigation.

## Repository Included
1. **ROS Exercise: Robot Rotation Control**
   Simulates a robot that rotates in place and reacts to obstacles using ROS topics and sensor data.

2. **Robotic Control Algorithms: Path Following and Wall Avoidance**
   Implements PID control for following various paths and simulates wall-following behavior with laser sensors.

3. **Humanoid Robot Following and Maze Navigation in ROS**
   Simulates a robot following a humanoid robot and autonomously navigating through a maze by following walls.

## How to Run
Each project has its own set of instructions for compilation and execution. Please refer to the individual project folders for detailed README files that explain how to run each project.
