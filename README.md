# Robotics Course Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the **Robotics Course**. The projects focus on various robotics principles, control algorithms, and simulation techniques using tools like ROS (Robot Operating System) and sensor-based navigation.

## Overview

Throughout this course, the emphasis was placed on understanding and implementing core concepts of robotics, including:

- **Mobile robot control**: Developing control systems for autonomous mobile robots.
- **Path planning and navigation**: Implementing algorithms for predefined path following, random destination generation, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Sensor integration**: Utilizing sensors such as lasers and cameras to enable environment perception and interaction.
- **Simulation**: Simulating real-world robotic tasks using ROS and Gazebo.

Each project in this repository corresponds to a specific task or set of exercises assigned during the course. Inside each project folder, you will find its own detailed README with information about the objectives, methods, and results for that particular task.

## Project List

1. **Mobile Robot Control**: Implementation of various control algorithms, including PID control, for tasks like path following and wall-following.
2. **Sensor-based Navigation**: Projects that focus on integrating sensors for environment detection and path planning.
3. **Simulation with ROS**: Using ROS to simulate different robotic behaviors, such as maze navigation and humanoid-following robots.

## Technologies Used

- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**
- **Python & C++** (for algorithm implementation)
- **Gazebo** (for simulation environments)
- **Sensors**: Camera, LIDAR, Laser, etc.
